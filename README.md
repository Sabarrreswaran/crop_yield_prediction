# Crop Yield Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 🧠 Overview
This project predicts agricultural crop yields using machine learning techniques based on environmental and farming factors such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, and crop type. It aims to help farmers and agricultural planners improve productivity and decision-making.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:
- Crop Type
- Area (in hectares)
- Production (in tonnes)
- Temperature (°C)
- Rainfall (mm)
- Humidity (%)

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and inconsistencies
- Converted categorical values using Label Encoding
- Normalized numerical features for better model accuracy

## 🤖 ML Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

### 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- R-squared (R²)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

The model with the highest R² and lowest MAE was chosen as the final predictive model.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries (`pandas`, `sklearn`, etc.).
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
4. Input sample values to get yield predictions.

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Incorporate more granular and real-time data (e.g., satellite weather data)
- Add a user-friendly web interface using Flask or Streamlit
- Extend predictions for multiple crop seasons
